Here, I have used the following tags:
<h1> : to display headers
<p> : to write the paragraph or description of products
<div> : for the partition of the pages 
<favicon> :  its been used for showing the icon of the company.
<img> : to showcase the differnet coffee images to make it look interactive.
<a> : its been used to provide an hyperlink
<table> :Consists one element or more
<tr> : tr defines a table row 
<th> : defines element inside table headers
<td> : defines element inside table cell
<form> section of document which contains text fields
<select> to collect user inputs
text-decoration = Specifies the decoration added to text
text-align = Specifies the horizontal alignment of text
font-family = Specifies the font family for text
font-size = size of the font
padding = A shorthand property for all the padding-* properties
width = Sets the width of an element
overflow = Specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box
